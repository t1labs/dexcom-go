# dexcom-go
This package serves as an SDK that makes it easy to interact with the Dexcom API. We make use of a simple design,
exposing the most critical data in structs that are easy to consume.

Supported Methods:
- [x] Calibrations
- [x] Data Range
- [x] Devices
- [x] Estimated Glucose Values
- [ ] Events
- [ ] Statistics

Please feel free to make a pull request to support more methods!

## Example
```go
c := dexcom.New("<your-access-token>")
egvs, err := c.GetEGVs(time.Now().Add(-1 * time.Hour), time.Now())
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

fmt.Println(egvs)
```

## Sandbox Mode
To test with Sandbox data, simply overwrite the `Endpoint` field on the `Client`. An example:
```go
c := dexcom.New("<your-access-token>")
c.Endpoint = "https://sandbox-api.dexcom.com"
```

## Debugging
Sometimes, it is desirable to have logs for each request, and logs detailing errors when they happen. To log information
from this package, implement the `Logger`, and overwrite the `Logger` field on the `Client`. An example:
```go
c := dexcom.New("<your-access-token>")
c.Logger = myBeautifulLogger{}
```

Obviously, you should not panic in a real-life scenario. This example will return all of your estimated glucose values
for the past hour.

## Contributing
- [ ] Better error handling (status code checks, logging, etc)

## Testing
We use an environment variable `TEST_ACCESS_TOKEN` to run our integration tests. To run the test suite, this variable 
**must be set**. To run the tests:
```sh
go test -v github.com/t1labs/dexcom-go
```
